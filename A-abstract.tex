This work consists of unifying contemporary approaches in the evaluation of cardiomyopathy. By supporting radiomic analysis, which extracts information from statistical and texture features from medical images, and features derived from a classic neural network for computer vision, like the ResNet50, it is possible to obtain promising results. The results certify that the combination of information from various fields regarding a given patient, when allied, can lead to more interesting outcomes compared to when the data are evaluated in isolation. The present work aims to use the aforementioned approaches, based on previous literature, to perform a novel application for cardiomyopathy testing, adapting and proposing a more robust architecture to achieve good results.
